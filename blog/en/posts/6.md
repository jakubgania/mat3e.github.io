# Udemy course

Recently I've started recording my first video course, focused on modern front-end techniques.

I'm a fan of JavaScript applications, with a minimum number of libraries/frameworks, so I focused on [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com/) and on the modern web browsers. Main topics I talk through:
1. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
1. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
1. node's `require`, `module.exports`
1. ES6 modules
1. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
1. `var` vs. `let` vs. `const`
1. destructuring
1. classes, class vs. `function`
1. default parameters
1. `fetch`
1. `async`, `await`
1. `filter`, `map`, `forEach`, `for of`
1. Web Components (templates, shadow DOM, `customElements`)
1. markdown
1. GitHub Pages, GitHub API
1. emoji
1. CSS modules
1. Composition over inheritence
1. shorthand property
1. `Object.assign`
1. spread operator
1. decorators
1. generators
1. Babel, TypeScript
1. unit testing
1. debugging
1. working with the console

During the course we build programmer's portfolio with a blog like this one. There are many problems to be resolved and I explain everything at the semi-advanced level.

So far, the course is only in Polish, but the price is great, so let me know if you are interested in English subtitles. And just buy upfront, because I will translate everything even for a single person :)

I also consider recording everything in English, but it depends on the level of the interest.
